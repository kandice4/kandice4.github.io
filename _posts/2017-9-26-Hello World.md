title: Hello!

Hello world! It is Week 2, Day 3 of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp and
this is my first blog. After having spent the year teaching at a project based
high school, it is really exciting to be in the student seat
at a project based bootcamp.

Our first project was a week long and unlike the rest of our upcoming projects
was a collaborative team effort. What a relief that was! Having only recently
taught myself python, I felt utterly wrecked by pandas this week. I am someone
who operates with the mentality that if I think something should be possible, it
must be possible. Therefore, its just a matter of figuring out how to do it. This
resulted in my getting caught in a debugging net that prevented me from making
timely progress analyzing the data set that we were assigned.  

Rather than get bogged down by pandas, I utilized my team's skills to help
overcome some coding challenges and I was able to contribute my skills of data
analysis to review my teammates results for reasonability and accuracy. My
extended domain knowledge allowed me to identify some pitfalls in the data
aggregation and my breadth of perspective helped to guide the exploration into
a meaningful direction for the fictional client. By assigning distinct roles
throughout our team, but also allowing time for individual exploration, we
ensured that we were not duplicating excessive effort but also allowing each
member to learn from each other.

We would share code to keep everyone working with the same dataset and we
would regularly check in on the status of our work. Communication was a key
element of our success as a group. Additionally, by leveraging each other's
strengths, we were able to each bring something unique to the project's end
result. For example, I stepped up to craft our narrative for the presentation
which ensured a story flow that might not have been as easily achieved if we
had each just done our own things separately and then brought them together. By
making sure each piece fit our story, we were able to create a more cohesive
presentation. I also feel that my eye for detail and my data questioning and
skepticism helped to keep our analysis reasonably accurate and meaningful.

I really enjoyed working on the project with my team. I still have a lot of
learning to do to become fluent in pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn but with
more and more tools coming at us in the coming weeks, I am definitely swimming
with the water at neck level.  :wink:
